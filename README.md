# ShutTheFuckUp

Small game made in a month with Unity and Pixel Art. The theme of the jam was censorship. My goal was to create a simple yet complete game with a round system and a dynamic dialog file system.

The game can be played by [Shut The Fuck Up](https://github.com/marcelurpi/ShutTheFuckUp/blob/master/Builds.zip).
